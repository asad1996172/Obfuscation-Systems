firstly,
in addition,
moreover,
on the other hand,
secondly,
in conclusion,
on the one hand,
to begin with,
thirdly,
in sum,
anyway,
like,
right,
you know,
fine,
now,
so,
I mean,
good,
oh,
well,
as I say,
great,
okay,
mind you,
for a start,
uh,
um,
yes,
no,
thus,
therefore,
in brief,
on the whole,
summing up,
to conclude,
in conclusion,
as I have shown,
as I have said,
hence,
therefore,
accordingly,
thus,
as a result,
consequently,
for example,
for instance,
in this case,
in another case,
on this occasion,
in this situation,
take the case of,
to demonstrate,
to illustrate,
as an illustration,
to illustrate,
and so forth,
next,
then,
following this,
at this time,
now,
at this point,

in fact,
indeed,
in any case,
absolutely,
positively,
naturally,
surprisingly,
always,
forever,
perennially,
eternally,
never,
emphatically,
unquestionably,
without a doubt,
certainly,
undeniably,
in brief,
as I have said,
as I have noted,
as has been noted,
immediately,
thereafter,
soon,
after a few hours,
finally,
then,
later,
previously,
formerly,
next,
and then,
because,
for,
since,
for the same reason,
obviously,
evidently,
furthermore,
moreover,
besides,
indeed,
in fact,
in addition,
in any case,
that is,
whereas,
but,
yet,
on the other hand,
however,
nevertheless,
on the contrary,
by comparison,
where,
compared to,
up against,
balanced against,
vis a vis,
but,
although,
conversely,
meanwhile,
after all,
in contrast,
although this may be true,
and,
again,
and then,
besides,
equally important,
finally,
further,
furthermore,
nor,
too,
next,
lastly,
what's more,
moreover,
