If you cognize of anything become on future calendar_week in miami delight post it here encase i get bore of look at the wave and my household's expression. I will be sway the white_potato vodka, bellow! Wednesday i run_low to see the killers and stellastarr * at irving_plaza with karenic. I badly can non get plenty of the killers. I desire to necessitate a calendar_month off piece_of_work and come_after them approximately like a bally deadhead fetid hippie or something. If the francis_ferdinand show was a homoerotic experience, then the killers show was the straight equivalent_weight. I precisely trip_the_light_fantastic approximately with the large stupid smile on my human_face for the ease of the nighttime and feel like i give_birth precisely hold nativity to a gorgeous babe of stone that i rapidly discard of in a dumpster and_so could go_on my nighttime. I desire to stick the member of the killers (and their roadie and thier coach) in a box and hold_on them thither and_so i could jab them every time_of_day or and_so and be like " dedicate me love, " and they would quick get_down sing and act their instrument and i would trip_the_light_fantastic approximately and shout " you guy_cable are amazing! " Until i suffer to suffer back to function. Ambulance ltd were besides rather bang-up. I suffer non seen them execute for most a twelvemonth and i was precisely in such a well modality after the killers that they could suffer set on a icky show and i would suffer been float... but fortunately they actually set on a adorable show. I feel like i was in some kind of 1960s picture about california or something. And then stellastarr *.... beloved stellastarr *, i suffer a trouble with you. Why_the_fuck_are_you_so_fucking_good? It is condemnable. I utilize to survive see them act at luna and arlene's and they were bang-up then and i was like " they are bang-up immediately. They will get better. " But their show blow my expectation. My blood_brother, was bounce approximately like a imp on a trampoline with set. I cogitate they enjoy the show more then anyone. Their new vocal is bally bang-up. That was my 1 clip listening it and killer_brandon suffer warn me that that vocal suffocate him up each clip. I begin tear up and look behind me at nina and gina and begin embrace them. Ohio, the love. The after party was receptive bar and since i was djing_i practice non real suffer to pay. So i encounter a clump of vocal and trip_the_light_fantastic approximately like i suffer a ictus, fuddle a_lot. People buy me drinks give_thanks you to those people.

Include the djing, i was in full on piece_of_work manner since i am doing a " making out with ultragrrrl " for the three band... the ironical thing about my pillar is that i do non in_reality make out with anyone. For one thing, i am non leave to for ethical reason (which i am actually rather interest in being -- ethical), and second, despite the manner i write and speak about band, i suffer been cognize to run far aside from male_child who play musical_instrument. I precisely execute non day_of_the_month musician (i am even more frighten of dating actor). This makes my task therefore null of enticement. Immediately if i suffer to cover unemployed artist with " kernel insult trouble " for a support... I may suffer a trouble on my hand. As far as my parent are refer, i merely appointment doctors. Hey_andy. Last nighttime i run_low on this booze_bus thing that twirl form. It was fundamentally a busbar full of high terminal fink by royal_elastic and a clump of people who function and a_lot_of liquor and the ravonettes. It was one of the more eccentric work experiences i suffer of_all_time suffer and i was try difficult to impart my 17 twelvemonth old self who would suffer cogitate that function at twirl was like this every day of the calendar_week. It kind of is and the ravonettes with tracey_pepper and sia_michels. Non really bad actually! Cept, in my phantasy nobody laugh when i say " muse is one of the best band out thither. " Then i run_low to irving_plaza to gather up with craig from the fine university_of_connecticut. I suffer to duck into a cake to utilize the lavatory which overflow like a horror picture or something. I suffer precisely enough clip to launder my hand and function out, state the bar guy_cable " dandy, the commode us break. " When i get_going outside i get_going state craig what happen when some wholly cunning male_child walk by and state " why execute non you blog about it? " Therefore here i am. Real, i am merely blogging about it induce i cogitate it was amusing that some random child said something. I am reasonably open_up to prompting sometimes. So craig and i run_low to link to eat dinner and fuddle some beer and and_so gather up with sarah_wilson at irving_plaza so we could faint over the walkmen. J'adore lupus_erythematosus walkmen! I suffer no idea why, but lady_emma_hamilton remind me a_bit of mary_j._blige when he sing. I cogitate i precisely cogitate of mjb's execution on some vh1 particular a few twelvemonth back that appear so despairing and fantastic and there is something about the manner lady_emma_hamilton sing that is real much like that. To me at_least. It was the walkmen that form me love radiohead less. They were execute things that radiohead discontinue execute after ok_computer. What i intend is, there was something miss with child a... similar humanity. Ok_computer change my liveliness wholly. It's because_of that album that i occupy function in the discipline of music badly. There were eternal mistake on ok_computer that made them appear vestal, and it appear like there were none on child a. Or the glitter was survive. Something. The walkmen tho, they constitute execute something vestal and organic. They sound like a bibulous nighttime in love. But you cognize, possibly my gustation precisely change. Is it weird that i however love muse? Okay. Clip for me to survive household so i can suffer shabbat dinner with my household and snog my pooch on her olfactory_organ and hear my dada state " i dont understand what happen... you utilize to be and_so... Scraggy. " And hear my ma say " it is all the fuddle you are execute. " And then hear my buddy say " yeah, you fuddle like a pisces. " And then speak to laura on purpose about adolescent male_child.
