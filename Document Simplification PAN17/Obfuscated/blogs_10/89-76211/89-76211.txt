Excessively buttocks a listing of recently: happy belated_thanksgiving - it was good talk to the irish_gaelic side of my family for 2 hour last calendar_week - it was in_reality worth getting up at 6am even_though i suffer to hear the defeat in my 13-14 twelvemonth old cousin' voice at listening that i however suffer no share-able male_child comment for them. ; -) my_life writing path from a pair calendar_week ago was grand. I even win one of my coach's novels and self-destruction effort. Really arduous reading about such things when you cognize the individual, but gratefully i cognize that there was a positive end. It is a really perplex novel. Flat ornament 201...the flat is slow but certainly getting better. In fact but it precisely might be the 1.25 star motel immediately. I may suffer affect up a one-fourth of a star - wheeeeeee! I no_longer construct any eye-contact with anyone on the street my position building is on as it suffer been necessitate over by construction worker construct and tear material down all up and down the street, on both sides. There is nothing like cat-calls 1 thing in the morn, at luncheon, when leave piece_of_work, when travel for chocolate test, you mention it. They will sing at anything. It is smokey. It smell like a bbq all over sydney. I precisely can non get over the bush-fire folly. I cognize, it happen every twelvemonth, but i precisely can non get my mind around it. One of my colleague leave work after luncheon today to survive household and hold_on an oculus on his household.... to make certain it was non survive to be burn down. Yikes. Precisely can non conceive_of that. I estimate i suffer accept small springfield for accord. We perform snow. And we'd a hurricane formerly, but no george_bush fire.

( yes what sort of 7 twelvemonth old hold_on a journal? A nerdy one, that is what. ) Anyhoo, i would write my deep idea and concern, which by_and_large deal with things like, " beloved journal, delight assist me, i perform non cognize what to perform.

His role is the perfect guy_cable (i.e. The guy_cable who would ne'er like me) who is cunning, melodious, laid-back, go-with-the flow, sweet, sensible, romanticist, fresh, amusing, and he cognize the answer to all of ally's problem. That's saying a_lot because ally suffer a_lot_of trouble. Then i receive myself acquire discompose that his grapheme would of_all_time light for such a nut-job like her. I sleep_together but i suffer suffer more clip to cogitate about this immediately that 24 is over. : (i saw harry_potter the other twenty-four_hours. Love it. I love it even_though it can non even arrive near to compete with the volume. Non even near. I have_got to forbear from have_got my hand up in the air_travel every clip they change something stupid, but i was however happy i travel to see it. It was eccentric listening all the male_child voice change! And yes, i excessively am a soiled old adult_female precisely like this cool biddy for cogitate that the histrion act oliver_wood is endearing. Excessively bad he is merely 19.
