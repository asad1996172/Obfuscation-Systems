This morn was one of those morn when i awaken up and appear at the ceiling think " where execute this narrative start? How'd i get here? " To be honorable, i wrote that sentence a few time_of_day ago and suffer the bad lawsuit of attention_deficit_disorder today that i precisely suffer non been able to write beyond that tune. Immediately i suffer suffer a cup of java and am gonna seek my best. And_so i push karenic to drop her design and bring_together me for the living_things / velvet_revolver display at roseland that nighttime. Her plan, give_birth consist of run_low to bbkings to see the vocalist of squeezing execute an acoustical set. As_if she reallly desire to execute that! And_so after study i travel with the colleague to passer-by in the fine_art territory for bon_voyage drink for those who induce decide to leave twirl. I decide to induce it an " exclusion nighttime " and induce a pair of beers and a one-half time_of_day recently i was on my manner to the display with my editor_in_chief to gather up with karenic. You cognize how in the 4 question of the haggedah you inquire " why's this nighttime different from any other? " . Karenic and i stand approximately inquire precisely that. There we were in a locale we both cognize all excessively intimately, and yet, there was non a single familiar human_face in the theater. I was already sauced and hyper from the beer and redbull i consume consume that i kind of bounce forth the wall. The independent ground i survive to the display was to see my friend evening's band, the_living_things. I suffer non seen them since they open for the libertines back in the summertime when barry was however 19. Doug suffer seen them at cbgbs a pair week early and state it was one of the best stone register he is of_all_time seen, so i was like " hot darn! I am arrive! " I intend " i am survive! " Or whatever. Their display was bang-up and lillian is a bang-up frontman. He undress forth his shirt and execute topless a_lot to mine and karenic's joy during which he urge the audience to non vote for shrub. To render you an thought of what the crowd was like, some meathead start call lillian the " newton " word. That audience fellow_member is a decelerate puss who refuse lil's request for him to arrive on degree and duke it out. This dandy's friends were beyond obstruct according_to band fellow_member who saw the whole thing from degree. The thing i execute non like about the display, which was non the band's mistake, was that you could scarcely hear them. Seemingly the vr execute non desire the opener to be loudly then them. Karenic and i walk approximately a_bit and i spot someone who appear very familiar. " hey appear! " I say to karenic, " it is the vocalist of the charlatans_uk! " I survive up to see if it was him. He say ordinal_number I walk aside think " that is and_so weird, it appear precisely like him. " Um... yeah, i constitute a entire douche_bag. It was the vocalist of the stereophonics and i wholly got the bands confuse. Yeah, estimate who is a bally decelerate. Me. Anyhow... So the velvet_revolver take to the degree and weiland, who's undeniably hot as bally perdition, fare out dress like the jocund police_force policeman from the village_people and start dress his serpent terpsichore. Karenic and i spot this dandy walk approximately with the tight trouser of_all_time and a furred jacket with no shirt on underneath. He appear like the love kid of justin_hawkins_of_the_darkness and rob_harvey_of_the_music_and_slash. I tend over to him so i could induce a photograph with him induce his expression was precisely excessively incredible, and he was more then agitate to perplex with us. The male_child was create to be photograph... and the male_child suffer a kind of business card that was his photograph and entanglement address. The male_child's name was lips_velvet. Delight match out his web_site so you suffer an thought of what the screw i am talk approximately. After i put with mr._velvet but karenic decide that she induce plenty of the velvet_revolver and decide to steer downwards to the east small_town for the radio4 listening party at hifi where she canoodled with celebrated flower_people and seek to convert them all to h.i.m.... i fail at change_state downwards evening's offer of alcoholic beverage (he's like " i_know_for_a_fact that you induce " exclusion " nighttime for your drink. I read your web_log. This is one of those nighttime. Immediately what execute you desire? " Consecrate that male_child). I trip_the_light_fantastic like a serpent with the livingthings as we freak_out out whenever the vr play g'n'r vocal or s.t.p. vocal... and particularly when they cover eden's " negative weirdo. " Execute tommy_hillfiger suffer a buddy who appear precisely like him? Grounds if therefore, he was thither with michael_h, who's never without his sunglass seemingly. Besides, cory, who'sn't a berlin_brother but from saint_louis and in the living_things, appear precisely like a young and healthy adaptation of scott_weiland. It was eldritch. He is officially the new_cory. As in, motion over corey_haim and feldman, there is a new cory in town and he spell his name without the due_east. after the display i went with the brothers_berlin to the hotel_gansevoort_for_the_clive_davis / velvet_revolver party. We load up on the liquor and chase the dandy down who were transport plate of food_for_thought since we are all break and i block to eat dinner that nighttime. The party appear like something out of a hollywood party and and_so i drink to block where i was. Whenever i go to these event, the record company parties, i am like, " ohio, i very dont belong here. " And wait patiently for someone to gain that i consume crash the party and complain me out. They ne'er execute. I affirm, the future clip i go_to a party on that deck, and it is above 80 degree, i am jump in the puddle with all my apparel on. Up until immediately, nyc precisely suffer non very buy into that whole " hey, my name is mr. weather_condition, i am gonna be hot immediately, " alternatively, i suffer been wear batch of layer. Justine_d showed up and convey some of her ain personal sunlight. It is e'er adorable to see her! When we were wholly feed up with the free food_for_thought and drink we all hop in cab and steer forth to tartan and i feed up and travel place result the kid dress in black to roll the street entirely in the rainfall. The terminal. By the manner, i precisely got the sons_&_daughters_ep and it is very bally bang-up. I estimate the vocal i download forth the net precisely execute non execute their recording a_lot_of justice because the ep wholly capture the unrecorded display very well. I intend, you dont get to see a quartette of half very hot male_child and half very hot girl sing and trip_the_light_fantastic while you listen to it, but it is near plenty. They are gonna circuit with francis_ferdinand, therefore be certain to match them out. The killers were on mtv a pair day ago as a you_hear it number_one. I suffer non been able to witness the link to the segment, but if you survive to their web_site you can witness their music television. I am survive to a promenade with mark_killers. I am agitate! If dan_marcus were however in high school, he would've jump on a carpenter's_plane to detect this mammoth mushroom. Someone think that damon_albarn is a puss. They may or may non be right he's however bally hot. Overcharge from morning_theft suffer suffer me into the sheila_divine once_again. Delight insure out their vocal " humming " by sound here. In fact, the whole album is very good... I precisely very love that vocal a_lot. Planet family_guy for those who are equally obsess as me. Radiohead run_low yeehaw! . Decidedly listen! Link from adam_berger. This cat-o'-nine-tails is screw!
