Why be tape_sticky? Thither be no chemical_substance adhere or chemical_reaction between a pressure-sensitive adhesive_material and the substratum, the surface to which it bond_certificate. A pressure-sensitive adhesive_material be a gluey liquidlike stuff that cling to a surface use lone atmospheric_pressure. To work considerably, it should've good adhesion to a surface and good coherence, or internal strength. Permanently adhesion, it be of_import that the adhesive_material can readily run out on the surface. The grade of the flow frequently determine the intensity_level of adhesion. Degree of flow depend on the difference between the surface department_of_energy of the stuff and the surface department_of_energy of the adhesive_material. Pressure-sensitive adhesive_material be_given to run out on fabric suffer a high surface department_of_energy -- for_example polycarbonate and nylon. Pressure-sensitive adhesive_material be_given non to run out as easy on low surface-energy stuff such as polythene, polypropene and polytetrafluoroethylene. Mechanism for adhesion include both mechanical adhesion and specific adhesion. Mechanical adhesion occur when the adhesive_material run into the texture of the substratum. Specific adhesion includes static force, van der waals force and acid-base interaction that accept topographic_point between the adhesive_material and the substratum. In the font of acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive_material, the intensity_level of the adhesiveness typically increase over clip. This originate level of' stickiness' happen' induce of the long clip it necessitate for the adhesive_material to run onto and into the surface texture, and for the adhesive polymer to array with the surface to make the interaction.
