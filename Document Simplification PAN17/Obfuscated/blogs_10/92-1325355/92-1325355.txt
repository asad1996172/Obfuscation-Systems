Script intelligence: 1/23/2004 the thing about the dean_scream is non real about the screaming (it was more of an out-of-breath yip anyhow). It's about a politico who's then focus on the cause that the cause is what he talk approximately. If you view the other campaigner' address, they immediately begin talk about the'ssues that they feel are of_import. This mean acknowledgment that the cause is a mean, non the goal. In dean's address, the political_campaign, the listing of state that they are survive to survive to, is what's of_import. I was non peculiarly impress with kerry's or edward_iii's speech_communication, but at_least they are consequence focus. Dean arrive across as rowdy_roddy_piper from the world_wrestling_federation pre-declaring triumph in the town the wwf will call_in. ( possibly i was precisely peeved that pelican_state cause non cause it on the listing. . . ) One of the criticism of the current judicature is that they are use the breadstuff and circus of a minor prescription_drug drug welfare and versatile military conflict as a manner of keep their handle on baron. Considerably, in dean's screaming speech_communication he perform non look real different, precisely more awkward. When perform beat_up the troop begin being about succeed for winnings interest and discontinue being about the things that impress ordinary people in mundane manner? Besides being undignified, it appear like his cause perform non suffer a clew what their message would be if they lose. The campaign-centered and uncorrected speech_communication indicate to me that either dean's team act non program for failure too as success or that dean act non come_after his team's program. Either manner is non a pretty view.
