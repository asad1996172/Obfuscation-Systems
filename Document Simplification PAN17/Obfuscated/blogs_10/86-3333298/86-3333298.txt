I accept a chinchy shooting at quentin_tarantino and give_birth open a can of worm. The remark i made about qt was unjust -- both to him and to eggers. Thither is no existent correlation_coefficient between the lit_boy_problem and any film_maker or grouping of filmmakers. There is no general unease and flop of filmmaking in any manner comparable to what's survive downwards in volume country. Which constitute non to state that there'sn't a similar position snip up with sure specific filmmakers. Similar, but non indistinguishable. I practice non desire to expend much clip on this, as i desire to necessitate a sleep, but briefly here are my view on both quentin_tarantino and the coens. Pierluigi necessitate care of the across-the-board stroke on quentin_tarantino. The lone thing i can state in his defensive_structure is that he appear to intend considerably. His film are a drawn-out love letter_of_the_alphabet to movie_theater. The fact that i regain all of his film bore and perchance that's even all_right. His basic artlessness and naivety piece_of_work to his vantage. Knock quentin_tarantino is a small like knock a decelerate individual. Even_if it must be perform, it perform non feel good. Knock the coens feels bally amazing. Ben create a strong font that their game suffer devolve. The last of their film i saw was the_man_who was non there, then i am non as up to snuffle as i should be. Wait buddy fare subsequently and i fare experience that. Whatever. It is all the same to me. I differ with ben and wharf likewise that the coens were of_all_time rattling good to start with. Fargo is a chef-d'oeuvre. Oxygen, buddy is a substantial exercising in literary allusion and playfulness mischief. The ease of it's precisely one solid fuzz of bad film. I rattling desire to like barton_fink but precisely can non convey myself to Other than that, i can non even accurately mark one film from another. The coens exert irony like a bazooka and far-out wit like a sled hammer. Their manner is shrink to those two things. My are non we dry and far-out? Irony is a powerful tool and should e'er be insidious. Far-out, dour wit can be use more munificently, but simply if the oddity serve a bang-up intent (which is non to state a bang-up message, but simply a bang-up esthetic system). Wit should never be a justification for its ain being. The coens perform non appear to gain that. To state that their new piece_of_work are " more hollywood " or " less energetic " is to miss what suffer been blatantly obvious from the origin: subversive_activity of genre can simply get you so far. Eventually you suffer to make something that's rattling your ain, that speak in a loud voice and that stand_up for something. The coens stand_up for nothing. They ambush behind the projector confess like please breastfeed hog when they bring_about their future indie chef-d'oeuvre of american irony. Perchance, ultimately, people are start to gain that these clown perform non suffer a classifiable manner or a definable esthetic theory or missionary_post. Their film lack both manner and subject_matter, and as such are equally empty as a musical_composition of artistic_creation can perchance be. In_addition, they suffer entrust the atrocious sinning of foist john_turturro on us in ineffably bad character after ineffably bad character. And that is insupportable.
