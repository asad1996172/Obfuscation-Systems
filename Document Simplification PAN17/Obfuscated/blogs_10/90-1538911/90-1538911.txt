Last valentine's twenty-four_hours weekend my friend anne and i took forth and drove to nyc. This was rather an escapade. Fortunately for descendants we videotape the whole thing and call it two fat_women in a landrover. Unluckily, i perform non cognize where the television is immediately. I cogitate she is got it. Anyhow, the 1 thing you suffer to understand is the transportation_system consequence. We live in wilmington which is rough 710 mile from nyc. I perform non drive on interstate if i can assist it i drive up 17. At_present most people cogitate this accept a_lot longer, but it actually act non, and the increase safety factor from induce me non be out of my head frighten really makes a difference. The three factor besides distance and driving idiosyncracies is the fact that i drive a 1995 jeep_wrangler, which suffer ne'er been classify in a' luxury vehicle' class. And_so primitively we'd decide to survive on january 23, but we'd a immense violent_storm here with a entire snowfall collection of four inch (you should've heard the guy_cable in the tarrytown_hilton when i constitute cancel our mental_reservation due to " snowstorm "). Badly this was a bad violent_storm here and function (at the clip was the nursing home-anne however function thither) would non let us leave_alone town. Yes, they can perform that when you are in admin. And_so we'd cancel and reschedule for valentine's twenty-four_hours weekend. We result thursday_night around 7pm. I e'er like to drive up at nighttime and back during the daytime to pose me in daytime on the to_the_highest_degree unfamiliar part of the ride. I have driven it so many clip it is form of a skill, and i cognize precisely where i ought to be when (ie. , if i leave here at 8, i should be at the chesapeake_bay_bridge_tunnel at 1am. This may appear overly anal_retentive, but it is all real carefully planned to hold_on me out of haste time_of_day traffic on the toll_road and head into the metropolis. Therefore happily we run_low. The 1 trouble is that anne suffer to urinate about every 6.4 mile. She is a much more easy type than i am-i be_given to be a_bit more torqued on average, and the 30_minutes arrest feature me wear to ribbon before we of_all_time strike the north_carolina / old_dominion margin. I am one of those nurse that can function all nighttime without e'er discontinue for the toilet (she's one of those nurse that suffer cause that and_so long it cause non function any_longer) and and_so by the clip we got to the bridge_tunnel she was grab the cell telephone and call local urologist to dress me up for exigency dialysis. We drove reasonably steady through the nighttime. She kip almost of the manner through old_dominion and old_line_state, and and_so we arrive across the shot of a railroad_train shipwreck with a immense accompany flame that detour us through the back wood of delaware for a piece. It perform non tap us overly much off schedule despite everything and we were on the nj_turnpike by 7. At this period i suffer to kip so we discontinue at that mccauley period or which of_all_time is the last / 1 period on the toll_road i ultimately travel to the toilet and i fall asleep for literally four minute. The sun was shine but it was surprisingly cold, and_so we decide to induce on with it since we were practically thither. I was give_birth in inwood at which clip we affect " upstate " to putnam_county. At the clip it was a wilderness-dirt road and the near traffic_light to our theater was ten mile aside. It is however reasonably rural, but nothing like it was. I lived there til 1993 and affect down here. Degree being, i cognize where we were survive and so_on, and_so it was non precisely like being tourer. We discontinue on the palisades and call piece_of_work and permit everyone cognize we were all_right. The river was frost up reasonably good and i could non believe how cold it was. You real perform get lean blood or something when you live in a warm clime. Then we intersect the bear_mountain_bridge, and since we could non travel to the hotel til that afternoon, we drove approximately to appear at everything for a piece. We spend the twenty-four_hours precisely wander approximately and a pair of double_temptation cake at the homestyle_bakery in peekskill. There are no diners in north_carolina. I am non certain why. The diner was / is an mental_hospital in new_york. You likewise can non get a difficult bun here. I precisely two week ago regain a topographic_point that makes black and white. It was an passing consequence. And_so we remain at the tarrytown_hilton, which is unusually considerably pose right thither at the tappan_zee span. I decide it was a good topographic_point to remain' induce it was so convenient to tube north and to the span and likewise' induce it was real chinchy. Thither is likewise a real nice diner (visit) across the street visit the el_dorado, where we ate supper every nighttime. The follow morn we got on the railroad_train and head to the metropolis. It was improbably cold. Anne is one of those real friendly southerly people who likes to say people she is from north_carolina and suffer never been here before. This form of send me into burst, but try to get her to perform anything is mistily like try to crowd cats-it perform non function. Therefore i leave_office myself to being tag a tourer for the whole slip. We were likewise surprised to regain out that this was the weekend of the big anti-iraq-war peace rallying. We meet several demonstrator and perform a real skillful interview with them on television for our' documentary'. Formerly we got to the metropolis, the design was to become to ground_zero via the east_village. Yes, i cognize what you are cogitate. Why on land would we perform that? ' cause there were topographic_point i desire to survive to. And we were walking, which is real the lone manner to see the metropolis. If you are non familiar with manhattan a real long walk. We begin forth down james_madison boulevard. At 31 st we regain a homo pose one-half on the pavement and one-half on the trough. We, good nurse that we are, be_given (trundle. We were dress like the michelin_man. ) Over to him and ask him what was incorrect. He afford his eye and afford us his name, then say " i am hiv positive. I necessitate an ambulance. " ( you see how i am hippa conscious, perform non you? ) Of path he necessitate an ambulance. His eyeball were wholly pinpoint. I perform non cognize how_much diacetylmorphine he perform that morn, but rather a_lot, and so we hang out and wait til the ambulances show up, throw our coat over him and so_on. The guy_cable was dress for a summertime twenty-four_hours. It contract about 30 minute for the ambulances to get thither. Batch of people were hang out of cab say us they suffer call 911 on their cell telephone for us. From there we transport on down to 23 st, view the public_violence police_force arrive storming in by the busloads to squelch the peaceable protest. There were helicopter viewgraph and everything-nobody was gull approximately. Formerly we got there we change_state east and head over to peter_stuyvesant and over once_again to boulevard a and tompkins_square_park. This is non the bang-up of all vicinity but it was of_import to me to survive thither. This was the 1 topographic_point outside_of republic_of_india that anyone publically intone hare_krishna. When srila_prabhupada foremost arrive this is where he travel to contain the 1 harinam sankirtan. Thither is a big elm_tree tree_diagram thither where he sit, and a plaque commemorate it. It was form of an emotional experience for me and i intone a small bit thither. I wish it suffer non been therefore cold. From there and_so we change_state onto saint_mark's and i got some luncheon from a topographic_point call vegetarian_kitchen and she got a hotdog from a topographic_point across the street call eat_me.  We warm_up up some and and_so we hold_on travel west on saint_mark's to 2 boulevard and change_state to_the_south thither. We walked all the manner down to the identical terminal that sphere. Gosh it is non therefore good thither, or was non last twelvemonth. We run_low to the temple thither at 26 2 boulevard. This was the 1 temple of_all_time in the united_states and where everything begin. I choose some movie and extend obesiances while anne run_low and regain a toilet. Formerly we result there we head towards chinatown. Over on grand_street we receive a tai eating_house call thai_angel and she desire to've some tea so we discontinue and acquire warm. We were getting reasonably tire at this degree. We'd tea and appetizer (real nice electrocute bean_curd and taro_plant), and and_so we pose forth once_again west. We suffer a good clip appear over everything for cut-rate_sale on the street. I buy a chapeau' induce she was wear mine and it was manner overly cold to non induce a chapeau. It is an ugly chapeau but everyone was wear one precisely like it, therefore i feel all_right about being unstylish. There was so much material for sale and even_though it is all precisely overpriced debris, it is however playfulness to appear. We walked approximately thither for a piece and then head forth down church_st to ground_zero. There was (i perform non cognize if it is however thither or non) a immense shrine across the street. People from all over the land and the populace had left things etc. It was real affecting to see. The whole sphere constitute rather crowd but real tacit, and the ambiance constitute real like a church_building. The web_site itself was non much-by immediately almost of the fix suffer been occupy care of and all it was, was a immense empty fix. It was weird to me to visualize things that i greet from picture that suffer been on the net after everything happen. On the chainlink environ of the web_site were several large plaques that suffer all the victim' names heel. There was a homo act' america_the_beautiful' on a transverse_flute, which create everything precisely a small mo eery. If i suffer non been so improbably consume by that degree i cogitate i could suffer appreciate it more. We remain for a small piece and then head home on the railroad_train. I love grand_central_station. We cope to catch an early railroad_train than we'd primitively cogitate and got home at a real decent time_of_day. The follow morn we were travel to result at 8 but you can non act anything on clip with anne, and_so at 10am we were out buy bagel and java getting ready to result. The cellular_telephone ring and it was my hubby letting us cognize that there was a blizzard head immediately towards us and to get the hades out of there. Of_course this arrive as a complete surprise to us (i fare non view the intelligence, non even in new_york) and and_so we arrive in the auto and arrive travel. By the clip we got to go_out 7 on the toll_road, we were seeing small snow bunny twirl on the roat. At outlet 5 it was snowing good, and at outlet 3 it was precisely about whiteout. We were driving and_so slow_down i was able to occupy movie, and anne was videotape. On the television you can hear on the radio_receiver that the whole state of delaware suffer precisely close down. We decide after some argumentation to run_low on 17. This was continue by my hubby who say the weather_condition would be worse inland. For the future 300 + mile we drove 35 mile an time_of_day. We'd to discontinue several clip to induce the water_ice off the windscreen windshield_wiper, and it was a good thing we'd the landrover' induce we'd to wax snowdrifts to induce to gas stations. Why perform non we discontinue? ' cause we cause non real induce any money, and all we'd to eat were difficult bun, bagel, black and white and two double_temptation cake. And_so we transport on and all the piece in the backrest of my head was the idea that the span tunnel might be close. We were practically hallucinating by the clip the snow change_state to rain_down. When we discontinue in virginia_beach at denny's (after 9pm) we were laugh and_so difficult at stupid things (cause non make me say you about the thyroid_family) that we almost suffocate on our supper. We ultimately got home at 4am. My knee_joint was and_so lock up that i in_reality fall over when i got out of the auto. I suffer to walk approximately for 10-15 minute before i suffer back in the auto. We bequeath a note say we'd precisely got in and would non be in that twenty-four_hours (monday. . retrieve, we bequeath on thursday). By the clip i got home it was about 8am. The telephone ring at 8:30 to let me cognize the state had show up and i had to function to function. I fare non cognize why to this twenty-four_hours they cause us fare in, but you can add it to the listing of reason i fare non function thither any_longer. We are planning on survive back, possibly in may, for a long weekend once_again, and we suffer likewise planned a slip to charleston (neither of us suffer of_all_time been thither). But this clip we are occupy anne_'s_explorer. It fare non fare out as amusing in print as it was in animation, but the future time we travel i will suffer audio web_log post so you can share in the delight. Suffer a good twenty-four_hours.
