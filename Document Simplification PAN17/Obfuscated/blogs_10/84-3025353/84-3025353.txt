Textual_matter calendar_week is down this morn. Credibly crash after despairing preacher everyplace begin hit the web_site look for something to state tomorrow nighttime. Meantime i slog through karl_barth on the incarnation. I should've perform this reading betimes in coming. There constitute nothing a_lot here about sheepherder and angel, but a whole batch on the annunciation and the doctrinal statement, " gestate by the holy_ghost; give_birth of the virgin_mary. " Karl_barth ask, toilet we in good conscience talk of the mother_of_jesus as the mother_of_god? Romanic catholic and orthodox_christians surely perform. Karl_barth state yes,' induce the word theotokos remind us that the one give_birth of the virgin_mary is the same one everlastingly beget by the male_parent. Unluckily theotokos suffer been contort by many accretion to christian mirror_image on the virgin_mary over the century. Virgin_mary, it's said, was perpetually a virgo (a opinion hold non merely by catholics but by early protestants such as martin_luther and heinrich_bullinger). Virgin_mary, it's teach, was besides gestate without sinning so_that she could be a vestal watercraft for gestate the son_of_god (the philosophy of the immaculate_conception). And virgin_mary perform non decease. She was assume into eden. Karl_barth cause non cause the obvious (protestant) degree that these accretion are non testify to in bible. He argue that the church_building go incorrect on virgin_mary when she go an main subject of theological probe, quite than a low-level subject under christology. What this leave to besides needfully a challenger. And where the catholic_church suffer suffer it incorrect about mary_for_mary is an picture of the roman_catholic. The church_building absorb a comparatively independent topographic_point in the redemptional procedure. To all this, state karl_barth, evangelicals can merely react with a make_noise confession of the sovereignty of jesus_of_nazareth who's lord_of_creation. Religion in jesus_of_nazareth hasn'thing to perform with the reciprocality of the human animal toward deity's program of redemption. True religion begin with abdicate all reciprocality, and acknowledge the shear baron and benignity of deity in jesus_of_nazareth to deliver. The catholic learner lawrence_cunningham makes the same observation about the turn in mariology in a slightly late article in theology_today. Merce_cunningham besides note that the second_vatican_council try to predominate in an severally function mariology. He mention the 1994 catechism_of_the_catholic_church which state and what it teach about virgin_mary light successively what it teach about jesus_of_nazareth. " He besides note That some contemporaneous catholic scholarly_person have_got call for a arrest in modern pronouncement about virgin_mary until the ecemenical impact of any such promulgation can be evaluate. Jitteriness however loiter in the catholic_church that the last deed of a dying catholic_pope may be to declare virgin_mary co-redemptrix with jesus_of_nazareth. For me, virgin_mary is more evidence that deity choose " thing that are non to convey to nothing the thing that are so_that no_one might tout in the presence of deity " (1 corinthians). Deity choose a bare, aged pair to be the parent of a choose people. Deity choose a vigilance_man to be the bang-up lawmaker. Deity choose the young boy of jesse to be male_monarch of state_of_israel. Deity choose a tormentor of the church_building to go the church_building's most effectual revivalist. And deity choose, who else? A virgo to render nativity to deity's boy. What a weird, mischievious deity we serve, a deity who's ever change_state thing upside down!
