Back online... for_now i cogitate it is official: i detest clip / warner line, or " brighthouse ", which is what they are call themselves immediately. They provide my chaparral_cock line modem service. For the ii time this twelvemonth, my service make tap out and remain out for most three twenty-four_hours. I suffer trouble with verizon from time to time, but i ne'er lost service for more than two twenty-four_hours. I run auction_sale on ebay and require to be able to communicate with possible bidder and auction_sale winner. I become up to new_port_richey on friday_night, everything was fine, but when i return betimes saturday_morning, i could non make on-line. We'd suffer a large violent_storm in the sphere and i estimate it tap the line modem out (the line television function fine). That is what happen last clip excessively. They ultimately make everything up once_again around noon today, but at_present my computing_machine is whacked-out. It look like windows_me suffer been corrupt. I can non act any of my mp3s (it state those data_file type are unsupported), i can non open_up my outlook_express (it state i may be out of remembering or my magnetic_disk may be full... neither is true), and windows immediately longer remember any of my password, no topic how_many clip i place them in. There is besides an internet_explorer picture on my desktop that was non thither on friday, that i perform non place there, and that will non permit me cancel it. It look like i am survive to suffer to pass_over my computing_machine... once_again. I am real make about that. Therefore... I estimate i will suffer to begin on the pass_over and recharge presently. Grrrrrr! !! !! !! Here's a summation of what i suffer been up to all weekend: friday we drive up to new_port_richey in a rainstorm. The baron become out at my sis's theater presently after we make thither. My brother-in-law and me headed over to bourbon_street to see tha zebra concert after a_bit. My friend eugene_sue was presuppose to survive excessively, but she choose to contend me in a kung-fu confrontation alternatively. Weakling! We suffer thither at 7:30 prime_minister, but they however suffer non open_up the doorway however. I saw 7:30 prime_minister on the bourbon_street web_site; i perform non gain that was precisely the clip the doorway open_up, i cogitate that is when the display start_up. Male_child, was i incorrect. There were a few other folk stand_up out in the rainfall excessively. I cogitate that was reasonably anserine. They should've let us in instead_of letting us get rain_down on. Eventually they permit us in around 7:45. We sit approximately wait for my sis to show up. She ultimately make thither around 8:15. We rate some food_for_thought and beverage. I suffer jalapeno popper and i ate some of their wing. They were weird taste and reasonably hot excessively, my sis suffice non desire hers, therefore i suffer a few. I merely drink coca_cola, no alcoholic_drink. The 1 band arrive on around 9pm. They were reasonably good, the biddy singer / guitarist particularly, but their option of blanket tune was non precisely my cup of tea (plus the biddy appear to sing about cocain and make high an dire batch... a trouble thither ?). They must've meet for at_least an time_of_day. We'd good buttocks, at table, right up_front to the side, but as presently as zebra arrive near to arrive on, everybody make their manner up thither and obstruct our opinion. I suffer to stand_up for the ease of the display... and it was a real long display. Zebra meet for most three time_of_day. They perform everything away their 1 album and four led_zeppelin covers! They were awe-inspiring! I could non believe how considerably they transfer what they perform on their albums to the unrecorded degree. I cogitate they would lose a_lot but that was non true at all. Aroused capital_of_mississippi and was tear it up on the guitar. The drummer was a freak, manner more impressive live than on candle. I could non believe precisely how good he was. Recently in the set, he perform a cram solo... it was intense. The bassist was bang-up excessively. He meet bass_voice montrose's " stone confect ". He was real cool, real friendly. He said that after the display, the band would be hang out and would sign autograph for everyone. How aplomb is that? Considerably, it'd've been aplomb suffer everyone non bail on me. My sis rip around 11:45. She said she was tire. And my brother-in-law desire to result after zebra result the degree the 1 clip. I suffer to twine his weapon to remain for their encore. He bolt after that, and_so i act non even cognize if they meet another encore. I was make tire by then excessively, but i however desire to remain. They were non much playfulness to be with. When the bands were act ne'er speak... nothing. I suffer no idea whether they were enjoy the display or non. I cogitate the lone clip my sis move was to match her lookout. I'd suffer suffer a_lot more playfulness if a sure someone suffer non of wussed out. Saturday we bring my nephew place with us. We result thither around 2:30 am, make place around 3:30 am. We remain up a small after that and then crash for the nighttime. I perform non suffer any excess money this weekend, and_so i perform non suffer to perform much with jess. I submit him to my band pattern at 5pm. We jam with that drummer from thursday_night. He look to be approximately his mid to recently 40's, non as old or as grizzled as i suffer conceive_of. He was all_right, perform a good task, but was non real impressive. He would be a strong, steady drummer and that is about it. Me, jp, and alabama were non at our best that twenty-four_hours, all of us blow character during one vocal or another. I would however suffer to say we are suffer considerably each clip out though. We meet all of the vocal we suffer act the last few clip precisely to suffer something to meet. Larry said he suffer two other bands to seek out for and he would suffer back to us, which i would conceive_of was his manner of saying " thanks, but, no thanks ". We may suffer another drummer this calendar_week the old drummer for the band. He is real good. Jess look like he was suffer bore, but he said he suffer a good clip and liked the music we act. On the manner over, jp choose a sharp left_hand and his acoustical guitar font fall on jesse's caput. It strike reasonably difficult, but he was all_right. jesse wind up act a_lot_of beach_head 2000 on my personal_computer this weekend. I showed him how and he run_low to town on it. We run_low out to eat at denny's and we chowed down. I suffer a doubled cheeseburger and child, plus a strawberry ice-cream_sundae. We normally ne'er purchase_order afters, but we perform this_evening. I wind up drink jesse's strawberry agitate excessively. His eye were large than his paunch. I was stuff. We catch basketball_game a small after we make place. We remain up recently on saturday. At 3:30 am and_so we wind up remain up til most 6am. Sunday we perform non perform a_lot at all. I meet with jess a_bit on the sofa, playfighting. Jess meet beach_head 2000 for for_a_while and i catch basketball_game until i could non hold_on my eye open_up any longer and travel back to bed. I awaken up at 10:30 prime_minister, and jess was aleady survive. I was sleepy-eyed all nighttime. I suffer to be up at 8am for the line guy_cable on monday and then survive back to bed until 8am. I wind up remain up all nighttime. Sunday constitute a entire wastefulness therefore at_least i perform something. Ohio yeah... jp call me today and i am decidedly survive to the bing_crosby, stills, and ogden_nash concert on wednesday! Yes! Unluckily, the ticket will cost me $85, it is at ruth_eckerd_hall, but i can necessitate my clip pay him for it. Sweet!
