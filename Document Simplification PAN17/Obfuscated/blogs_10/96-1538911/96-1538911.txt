I execute non kip once_again last nighttime. Today i am sort of stun (when was the last time i kip more than two hour ?). I run_low to the staff group_meeting at the hospital. It is decidedly non a good idea to drive anyplace near me. Switch is a_bit chancy with this manus. I cogitate they were run_low to call me in some more percocet, but i end up with vicodin. As i suffer said before, i execute non broadly like telecasting with merely a few exception. Anything about dinosaur or geology is good and some cartoon. Beyond that, i suffer non suffer a_lot utilize for it. These day, i cogitate the best character of television_receiver are the commercial_message. Here are some that stand_up out in my brain: current commercials: 1. The wingman commercial_message. I write a position on this formerly ahead, and_so i will non travel into the whole sociological quandary of it. The music stay in my caput, though. 2. The enzyte commercial_message. I suffer write about these before excessively. They are precisely excessively cutesy to non like. 3. The vardenafil commercial_message. These i can execute without. Who very desire to cognize about mike_ditka's sex liveliness? What i would like to cognize is how_much these celebrity are pay to get on telecasting and say they can non execute without pharmacologic treatment. * although_i must allow_in it was perfectly grand that mike_d. said in that one commercial_message that baseball_game as a athletics could utilize some vardenafil. Am non it the true_statement! I detest baseball_game. That i will hold_on for another position. 4. Thyroxine he office_depot Commercial with that provision guy_cable who dance approximately with his small roadster. I desire to function with this guy_cable. In most topographic_point, any employee that happy would be allow for drug examination. 5. The fedex commercial_message. They suffer a pair of good commercial_message run_low right immediately. The 1 with the guy_cable who is the master_in_business is good but this new 1 with' play' is better. 6. The whole' true' series from budweiser: all of these commercial_message constitute good. My current darling is the 1 with the referee spot the ball and talk about play on the football_game discipline. There was a commercial manner back in this series about a southerly guy_cable in a nyc bar, and i cogitate that may induce been the 1 one to grab my oculus,' induce they all said' how ya doin " and i ne'er very gain til and_so how new_yorkers say that. Bang-up past_commercial_campaigns 1. The 9/11 budweiser_clydesdale_commercial_arguably the best commercial of all clip and one that create me weep every clip i saw it. It was bathetic without being bathetic and however cope to hold_on its self-respect. 2. Snicker snickers suffer a streak of very bang-up commercial_message last twelvemonth or the twelvemonth before. There was one where the guy_cable paint the football_game discipline with the incorrect name and one where the signal_caller got reach in the brain excessively many clip and cogitate he was batman... there was a whole grouping of these that were very amusing. They suffer non been as good since then. Although the late 1 with michael_strahan is sort of cunning. 3. Volkswagen_i cogitate volkswagen suffer systematically made the best commercial_message over the past 10 or 15 twelvemonth. Whoever their advertisement people are, they should ne'er get free of them. I can cogitate of several bang-up 1 correct off the top_side of my brain: the 1 with the two guy_cable who pluck up the fetid chair the 1 with the music and everything constitute synchronize to the music and the whole series of new beetle commercial_message with the bloom ability subject. Volkswagen precisely create systematically good commercial_message. That's all i suffer on my brain right immediately. Today's agendum include knit, wash, getting in a nap (since i cause non kip last nighttime) and i would like to make some black edible_bean soup. It is cheery out but cold, therefore i cogitate it would be good. '); " > postcount;
