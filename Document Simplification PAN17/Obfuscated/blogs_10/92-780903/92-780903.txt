I be precisely view 60 proceedings (yes, i be real 75 year old ...) and literally flinch at something andy_rooney state during his comment at the terminal. He be talk about newspapers -- and i be non real certain what his item be -- he suffer about a twelve newspapers circulate across his desk and he suffer a pair of gossip about each one. " here in the asbury_park_press be an article about a adult_female who dress up her counterpart daughter in costume and send them to overcharge a depository_financial_institution... I inquire what her hubby perform for a animation. " And one of the last 1 he suffer be a college newspaper from the university_of_virginia -- the newspaper_headline and byline be call out on the screen -- " take a point_of_view permanently written_material " by jeffrey_eisenberg. And i think to myself his college newspaper article be on national telecasting. And andy_rooney say: " and here in the daily_cavalier a pupil wrote an article all almost good authorship. And it be written badly. " And i literally flinch. Regardless_of whether the article's good or non -- i detect it on the entanglement here but i suffer non read it yet, then i suffer no idea if it be good or non -- what right perform andy_rooney suffer to embarass a college pupil on television_receiver like that? He be non a professional journalist, and even_if the article suck, therefore perform most of what be in any college paper. I truly feel bad for the author. I intend, million of people view 60 proceedings. It precisely perform non feel correct to me. Possibly it precisely hit nigh to place because_of my jurisprudence school newspaper editorial -- i surely would non desire andy_rooney distinguish the universe i write badly, whether or non it be true. I suffer to inquire if i be overreact, or if this be real survive to change_state into a narrative. I will insure the uva newspaper tomorrow and the future twenty-four_hours to insure if there be any reference... edit to add: the article's from january_2002. The ease of the articles rooney talk approximately be about late event -- the oil oil_tanker tumble near kingdom_of_spain, john_kerry's explorative commission for president_of_the_united_states -- then why would he pluck this uva article from 11 calendar_month ago? The last article this guy_cable wrote, by_the_way -- but i conceive_of that be precisely a concurrence. I be perplex. At the real least, the fact that the article's so old mean_value that andy_rooney's careless to include it. But i inquire if there be more than that? I be a little perplex. And, yes, i cognize this be non worth the clip i suffer spend think about it...
