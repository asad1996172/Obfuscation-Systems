Permit us return to a subject i raise last calendar_week -- the essential dogma of the reformed religion as express in the confessions of the presbyterian_church. San diego_presbytery suffer identify six necessity and seven distinctives that are the kernel of our reformed custom in a newspaper style essential_tenets and reformed_distinctives. This position will appear at their 1 essential dogma, the authority_of_scripture. It is reasonably square. The christian_bible is deity's write christian_bible. It is the church_building's 1 and last authorization. We live to " love, follow, obey, cede and submit to god_'s_word -- both jesus_of_nazareth, the live christian_bible, and the scriptures, the write christian_bible. " The 1 coevals of protestant_reformers try to raise the authorization of christian_bible over against the education of church_building council and authorization. Etrd would necessitate a point_of_view on christian_bible solo non then much against fallible and even corrupt ecclesiastic authorization as against profane political_orientation. It deny any philosophy " that try to subordinate biblical authorization to any human authorization... whether religious philosophic or other... ". The newspaper besides insist that the fact of jesus_of_nazareth' animation decease and resurrection are historically true, and that biblical philosophy and ethical_motive can non be overturn. The writer of this part are clearly preoccupy with prop_up up the leave flank of the church_building. This handling of scriptural authorization suffer no forbearance for a developmental apprehension of christian_religion that might hold permission to change traditional christian_church education in visible_light of " new info " on homosexualism. They will non profess one shred to the modern universe survey that merely what's discernible, quotable and confirmable can be " true. " I inquire if this rampart against liberalism might non be a confessional maginot_line. In other words, is there a right flank that defender of the reformed religion might besides desire to guard? The confession of 1967 state that while the christian_bible is the christian_bible, it's " however the christian_bible of man, condition by the linguistic_communication, think word_form and literary manner of the topographic_point and time in which they were write... The church_building, suffer an duty to near the scriptures with literary and historical agreement. " The study_catechism (non a confessional written_document, but a good contemplation on current, mainstream presbyterian think) offer this inquiry and reply: " practise non modern critical eruditeness cave your belief that christian_bible is a kind of god_'s_word? Ordinal_number The method of modern eruditeness are a good retainer but a bad headmaster. They are neither to be accept nor refuse uncritically. Decently expend they can assist us justly and lavishly construe christian_bible; improperly expend they can assume the topographic_point of religion. Wise spokesperson utilize these method in the service of faithful witness and apprehension. The method of modern eruditeness stay a utile tool, while christian_bible stay dependable altogether essential subject of religion and pattern. " Etrd might've been strong on this dogma feature they admit that historical and literary unfavorable_judgment can assist us understand god_'s_word without shrink the christian_bible to " mere history " or " a good read. " As i said last calendar_week, the fundamentalist are long travel from the personal_computer (united_states), but it would be good to remind ourselves that mainline presbyterians perform non read the christian_bible with their mind stick in the sand. Jesus_of_nazareth, etrd will remind us is amply human and amply deity. If that is the ontology of the living_word, might we non state the same thing about the written_word, that the christian_bible is amply human and amply deity? Possibly this christological convention is behind c-67's statement that the christian_bible is the christian_bible and " the christian_bible of homo. " Sociology, psychological_science and account are non the concluding authorization for reformed_christians, but they can assist us explore the " true humanity " of holy christian_bible.
