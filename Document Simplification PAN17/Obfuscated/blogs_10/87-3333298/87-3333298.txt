Ben transport an onslaught of eggers's " literary journal " and a_bit of eggers-love. As an chronic enemy of all that eggers stand for in the universe of literature, i suffer more to say. Of path. But specifically, i suffer something to say about dale_peck's full-scale onslaught on american literature. 1 of all, it is clear that peck perform non suffer a rattling clear clasp of literary motion. He refer to dwight_lyman_moody and his ilk as " the eminent of canonic postmodernism. . . A belly-up custom... that begin with the diarrheal flow of word that's' ulysses'; continue on through the uncomprehensible ramblings of late william_faulkner and the unfertile invention of vladimir_nabokov. " James_joyce, william_faulkner and vladimir_nabokov are non postmodernists. The novels of james_joyce and william_faulkner are more or less the criterion by which modern_literature is evaluate. Post-modernism create a much recently visual_aspect on the shot. I will dismiss his remark on james_joyce, because i suffer non read the_great_book itself. Surprise surprise, i regain his onslaught on william_faulkner to be mislead. A_lot of william_faulkner's " late " piece_of_work are in_reality more accessible than his early piece_of_work. The least comprehendible of his novels is the_sound_and_the_fury, which was his 1 major study. The fire of vladimir_nabokov is even bad, but unwrap what sort of quarry peck is after. Of all writer in the canon of bang-up literature, vladimir_nabokov is the to_the_highest_degree esthetic and the least " content-driven " His demeanour defy analytic_thinking on the land that ignite crit demand. He suffer no " message " about the human status or division war or sex relation. Reading vladimir_nabokov is to render up on all of that bunk, and experience fine_art as a strictly phenomenal and esthetic animal. What peck intend by " unimaginative invention " is " it perform non intend anything! " As_if volume suffer a responsibility to hold us some sort of message. Peck's fighting is non a fighting against any existent failure in literature, but against manner. Peck is correct to assail the eggers crowd for their trust on an ill_at_ease and highly self-conscious manner and hence detect peculiarly annoying any writer who miss what he might cogitate of as " contented " and who choose for manner. Or possibly, even more annoying, are writer like james_joyce and william_faulkner whose matrimony of subject_matter and manner (the two are non, in fact, different at all -- once_again, adoption from susan_sontag) is more or less perfect. That does non intend that peck does non however manage to diagnose the job with most of the lit_boys (the exclusion, i intend, is the bang-up michael_chabon). It arrive at the terminal of his listing of the " postmodernist canon " in which he in_reality cope to place some postmodern writer -- viz. karl_barth and gaddis. I perform non like karl_barth. He is excessively self-satisfied and amusing for my taste. His volume are imaginative and courageous. They strike out wildly against the building of modernness that give_birth grow stale by the 1960s, in the same manner that other writer i perform non look_up_to (thomas_pynchon, edgar_rice_burroughs, mailer) perform in their ain manner, and that some i perform look_up_to (allen_ginsberg, philip_roth, jim_morrison, sacristan) perform besides. The trouble is self-generated approach against a literature that was smother them suffer bring_about its ain smother mass of copycat and poseur. Precisely as bret_easton_ellis give_birth consume william_faulkner's sear, basal manner and change_state it into something that appear someway stuffy and predictable, hence've eggers and sir_william_wallace consume karl_barth's manner (amusing, pelvis, self-satisfied) and change_state it into something bore and false. Instead_of writer courageously strike out to detect a new voice, we are result with the to_the_highest_degree objectionable leftover of antique manner. Peck is incorrect in that he see the lit_boys as the completion of a century-long flop of literature, but he's properly in that literature is in despairing indigence of a new motion to preserve it. The trouble is: i am non certain it can hap. As picture issue someplace in the 60s and 70s as non entirely an artform that could be take badly by critic, but besides as the major narration artistic_creation in united_states, almost of the man and woman who 50 year ago would've been write volume are immediately form picture. This is bang-up for cinema (although is non quentin_tarantino rattling the cinematic equivalent_weight of dave_eggers, throw together a medley of other manner without detect his ain voice? ) ' cause it induce turn the culture_medium in which experiment can however hap, and in which a fantastic sum of bang-up work is being cause. But it result literature with less and less. Precisely as the novel steal an eternal number of brilliance from poesy, and_so excessively suffer picture steal eternal brilliance from the novel. One of the bad excess on the lit_boys is the heavy-handed use of typographic mischief to get their volume " appear cool. " It is as_if the picture suffer invade the bible and_so far that we can no_longer retrieve that bible are get up of bible and non of picture. We must create the word appear like pretty picture and then call this " defy " and " bold " narration creativeness. I cogitate the novel can be preserve, but i am besides non that refer. All i desire is for immature writer to discontinue idolize at the communion_table of the barth-eggers-wallace_temple and begin written_material once_again. Or discontinue write and die get a bally picture, and result the universe or word undisturbed.
