Our domestic_dog, bree is a zhou / pit premix That we rescue back in 98. She suffer a broken leg and they'd suffer set her down if we'dn't claim her. Therefore she was precisely a babe (4 moment) and therefore we'd the operation perform and all. Anyhow, at the clip we'd cat-o'-nine-tails, but they suffer been survive immediately for a pair of year and she's really firm establish as the_dog_of_the_house. She love people. All people, any people. People who desire to break in, i am certain, she'd receive with receptive hand. But she hate animal. And insect. Bird. Frog. Anything non-human that motion.
