I am reading volume_i. 2. Of karl_barth_'s_church_dogmatics as setting for my sermon on christmas_eve and january_4. It accept karl_barth 800 page to say anything, and_so i suffer to footslog through a apparently interminable methodological treatment before i suffer to the sheepherder and wise man. I induce non yet detect anything applicable to our candle_flame service, but karl_barth induce induce in me new involvement in evangelism. The incarnation is the event in which deity unwrap himself to us. For karl_barth thither is no " demonstrate " this event. One can non start with a general thought of " deity, " a set of conviction about human nature, and and_so logically argue that something like what the new_testament says happen on christmastide is sensible. Nor will it perform " aha! Thither is the god-man! " The eternal_word take human flesh in_order_to talk deity's good intelligence of balancing is a self-authenticating event. There is no manner to argue or reason oneself to the true_statement of that event. Argumentation and reason flow from the incarnation, non toward it. An obvious ailment about karl_barth is that he is fideistic. That's, he use religion to demonstrate religion claim. But karl_barth insist that if we seek to argue or reason our manner to embrace the incarnation on some base other than the incarnation itself, and_so our theology are very idolatry. Merely the incarnation can tell us what deity is like. Karl_barth says that this oil picture by matthias_grunewald illustrate his theological method. Note that the human_face of the jesus_of_nazareth kid is bathe in the visible_light of the founder. Both virgin_mary and the angel in the refuge to the leave fasten their gaze on his beaming human_face. There is no manner to glance behind that drape to see deity immediately. Merely by appear at jesus_of_nazareth can we attend who deity is. I retrieve back in college listen to a preacher_man on nc_state's brickfield who was test to test the being of deity to a doubting audience. " if you see a ticker lie on the ground, then you cognize that someplace, there is a horologist, " he said. " therefore excessively, as we appear at the populace around us. If there is a universe, then there suffer to be a creator. " I conceive_of that karl_barth would've no forbearance with this statement, and non merely' induce it can non resist the compel and basically atheistical business_relationship of the natural earth put by evolutionary biological_science. If karl_barth were stand in the brickfield, what would he say? Possibly something as simple as quotation_mark 2 corinthians 5:19. " deity was in jesus_of_nazareth harmonize the universe to himself. " But what of the inevitable rejoinder, " demonstrate it! " Or even a soft, " why should i believe you? " What would karl_barth say to that? I'ven't read enough karl_barth to render an inform reply, but my conjecture is that he'd say something like what prince_philip said to nathaniel in toilet 1. When prince_philip announce that he would regain in jesus_of_nazareth what all state_of_israel was appear for, and nathaniel jeer, ask, " can anything thoroughly arrive out of nazareth? " Prince_philip reply, " arrive and experience. " Arrive and experience. The lone " test_copy " that " deity was in jesus_of_nazareth harmonize the universe to himself " is to follow jesus_of_nazareth. That intend attend those events where the event_of_the_incarnation is retrieve, the laud of god_'s_word and the share in the sacrament.
