Newcastle-upon-tyne: a natural_state and crazy_sorta_town_first of all nsw_australia is a eccentric small topographic_point. It is' pelvis and happenin' venue, public_house, restaurant, etc. Are by_and_large backpack into bantam reach of streets here and thither, leave to_the_highest_degree of the metropolis look like a ghost town even on friday and saturday nighttime. I can non retrieve how_many times we walk approximately saying, " um.... where is everybody? ?? It is friday / saturday_night, is non it? " The people that change_state out for the pupil media / writing / music / artistic_creation fete were as mind-boggling as newcastle-upon-tyne itself. Ne'er suffer i visit such a diverse option of dread-locks and bohemian-punked out peek wholly in one home. I seek to pay care to the treatment panelist it was all a_bit distract. Even more distract were some of the question people were ask. ; -) all altogether, it was a playfulness weekend. We suffer some real bang-up panel and some real shock 1. Highlight include " diy_tv " with santo_cilauro and panel on ad and music news_media include andrew_maloney and craig_new and i am non precisely absorb up because the last 2 guy are my friend. ; -) i am excessively lazy to write about any more panel, therefore i am stick with that. Other highlight include run_low to the art_gallery to consider this creepily cool aggregation of technology / media presentment. My darling would've to be the 1 that permit us contain image of ourselves then translate our face into weird / chilling / alien-like mug. It is call' personal eugenics.' We besides run_low to this melodious extravaganza at the cambridge_hotel. A_lot like newcastle-upon-tyne and the integral fete weekend, it constitute eccentric. There was some perplex electronic things hap in one room, while some awful biddy was destroy " private professional_dancer " in another room. Different artist rotate throughout the nighttime in the various rooms, but i am and_so glad to we choose to seek the last room (where all the good material was), if merely to get_away the eccentric people in the center room. You can merely necessitate and_so much of weird self-indulgent people in leather / latex / girdle necessitate change_state' trip_the_light_fantastic' and' sing' to program rhythm. The tensity of whether or non this one miss's bosom were survive to fall out of her girdle was precisely excessively much. I decidedly perform non desire to see that. We affect, and we regain some real cool stuff. If anyone who presently live in newcastle-upon-tyne or suffer live in newcastle-upon-tyne hap to live read this (though i can non conceive_of how you suffer of_all_time chance my web_log), i live die to experience what live survive on with newcastle-upon-tyne cabbies! 1 off: all the cabbies we in_reality suffer were improbably sweet! This one gentleman was therefore careful and considerate. Chaise and i suffer to compress into the front_end seat as there was an empty babe seat in the back and 1 he necessitate chaise if the air-conditioning was all_right for him, then he necessitate me if i was all_right with it. What a champion! So while the cabbies we suffer were adorable, the cabbies we perform non suffer were perplex and we perform non suffer a_lot more cabbies than we perform suffer. Confuse? All_right, on sunday_night we'd something like 4 or 5 hack caput towards us. We brandish insanely to herald the hack. And what perform the number_one_wood perform? Cause they pull over and pluck us up' cause they were empty and their visible_light was on? Ordinal_number Non entirely perform they non discontinue to pluck us up - they pulled a u-turn and change_by_reversal around and high-tailed it the perdition out of thither, accelerate down the street in the opposite direction. Wtf? ?? Possibly in newcastle-upon-tyne it is un-hip to gain $ as a hack driver? In any font, newcastle-upon-tyne stay real cryptic to us. There were batch of real adorable topographic_point - enceinte small / enceinte public_house but no_one was in almost of them! What was survive on? Possibly a_lot_of newcastlelites leave town for the weekend? I cause non cognize... but i cause suffer to indicate out that one of the almost distressing things i suffer of_all_time experience at a public_house occur @ the great_northern_hotel. Immediately, the gnh suffer a short_ton of possible as far as i am refer. Batch of comfortable seats, nice layout, bang-up terpsichore flooring, but all was non right with this universe! The disk_jockey was in the part of the public_house with the independent barroom - which is wholly no where near the factual terpsichore flooring. I cognize i torture poor sal and fidelma who suffer to listen to me rant on repeatedly about this. " what? But he is non even in the same room as the professional_dancer! How can you disk_jockey to people you can non even see? " The dandy would sometimes talk into the mic @ the professional_dancer, but it was real " adult_male behin the drape " a louisiana wizard_of_oz since no_one trip_the_light_fantastic could in_reality see him. We suffer a super breakfast on sunday at this cool coffeehouse with overly-nosy but plenty-cute waiter, and i consume a image of chaise's plate, which i will post here shortly, but my most celebrated repast of the weekend would've to be my chip-sandwich. How suffer i been here so long without of_all_time hear of this? I cogitate the crew was jesting when they mention make flake sandwich, but nope. They buy a loaf_of_bread of breadstuff, we rate a huge share of gallic child with poulet salt and stack the flake between the breadstuff with our sauce of option Pretty yummy! We suffer a eccentric thing hap during our mcdonald's pit arrest on the manner back to sydney tonight. Fidelma ask for some tomato sauce for her flake and they render her greenish catsup. Is this large in the states immediately?? In any font, it look sol weird to attend her put this foresty greenish sludge all over the gallic child. Look like a skill experimentation run_low incorrect. Particularly when the greenish sauce form it to the beefburger... but i was intrigue and ask for a clique of greenish sauce for my gallic child. The sauce smack the same, if_not sweeter, but stupid me perform non open_up up my pack rather plenty and when i compress, almost of the package dart out, splurting an impressive discharge over the tabular_array and onto the flooring. The klutz strike once_again! It was a identical playfulness weekend. Our hotel rock!  It was bang-up to make out of sydney for a piece, but male_child was it nice to drive back into sydney and see the beautiful sky-line and other sign of culture. And as chaise indicate out, it was comfort to see public_house backpack with people! Thanks to chaise for his superb driving and thanks to sal for change narrative about unmanageable customer with me. Ohio! And thanks to chaise for teach me some playfulness card game, but perform non cogitate you are make out of teach' golf,' mr! ; - )
